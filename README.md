Preprocess the CV: As with any country, we need to preprocess the Turkish CV text to clean it up and make it suitable for processing. This may involve removing any irrelevant information such as personal details or formatting information, and converting the CV text into a standardized format for processing.

Train the model: We need to train a GPT model on a large dataset of Turkish CVs that have been manually labeled with skills. This will allow the model to learn the patterns and structures that are typically associated with skills on a Turkish CV, and enable it to recognize skills accurately.

Tokenize the CV: Once the model has been trained, we can use it to analyze the skills from a Turkish CV by tokenizing the text into individual words or phrases. GPT can identify skills by recognizing keywords or phrases that are commonly associated with specific skills or areas of expertise in the Turkish language.

Extract the skills: Once the CV has been tokenized, we can use GPT to identify the skills that are mentioned in the Turkish CV. This may involve looking for specific keywords or phrases that are commonly associated with skills, such as "yazılım dilleri" (programming languages) or "proje yönetimi" (project management) in Turkish.

**Rank the skill**s: Finally, we can use GPT to rank the skills according to their relevance or importance to the job or position being applied for in the Turkish job market. This may involve analyzing the frequency of skill mentions in the CV, or comparing the skills to a list of required or desired skills for the job in the Turkish job market.

By using GPT technology to analyze skills from a Turkish CV, we can automate the process of identifying and ranking skills, saving time and effort compared to manual analysis. This can help recruiters and hiring managers in Turkey to quickly identify candidates with the skills and expertise that are required for a particular job or position in the Turkish job market.

#Job description analysis

Preprocess the job description dataset: As with any dataset, we need to preprocess the job description text to clean it up and make it suitable for processing. This may involve removing any irrelevant information such as company-specific details or formatting information, and converting the job description text into a standardized format for processing.

Train the model: We need to train a GPT model on a large dataset of job descriptions that have been manually labeled with skills. This will allow the model to learn the patterns and structures that are typically associated with skills in a job description, and enable it to recognize skills accurately.

Tokenize the job description: Once the model has been trained, we can use it to analyze the skills from a job description by tokenizing the text into individual words or phrases. GPT can identify skills by recognizing keywords or phrases that are commonly associated with specific skills or areas of expertise.

Extract the skills: Once the job description has been tokenized, we can use GPT to identify the skills that are mentioned in the job description. This may involve looking for specific keywords or phrases that are commonly associated with skills, such as "programming languages" or "project management".

Rank the skills: Finally, we can use GPT to rank the skills according to their relevance or importance to the job or position being advertised. This may involve analyzing the frequency of skill mentions in the job description, or comparing the skills to a list of required or desired skills for the job.
